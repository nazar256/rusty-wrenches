## Available Tools

### fix-nested-directories

A tool that helps fix redundant nested directory structures. It's particularly useful when you have directories that are unnecessarily nested within directories of the same name.

#### Features

- Automatically fixes redundant directory nesting
- Supports dry-run mode to preview changes
- Optional name matching skip for more flexible directory restructuring
- Safe operations with logging

#### Usage

```bash
fix-nested-directories --path <DIRECTORY_PATH> [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

- `-p, --path <PATH>`: Path to the root directory where to start searching for directories to fix
- `-s, --skip-name-match`: When specified, it will unnest folders even when they have different names than their parents
- `-d, --dry-run`: Preview changes without actually modifying the filesystem

##### Example

If you have a directory structure like this:
```
somedir/
â””â”€â”€ somedir/
    â”œâ”€â”€ file1.txt
    â””â”€â”€ file2.txt
```

Running the tool will restructure it to:
```
somedir/
â”œâ”€â”€ file1.txt
â””â”€â”€ file2.txt
```
